So we are looking to see if there is a way to download the emails from 1and1 servers and upload them to our whm/cpanel server so clients can have their emails and everything on our new cpanel server with their website. &nbsp; '),

Accept the offer of a chunky from the player before you, and post a picture of the chunky you are offering in the same post in which you claimed the chunky you wanted.  To make this easier, it is recommended that you make and add a few chunkies for this purpose to your gallery, perhaps marking them as pending or not available. Note: you are making a commitment to watch the thread and if your offering isn"t chosen in a week,  post another one. \r\n     2. PM the person whose chunky you have claimed, giving them your address, so they can get the chunky to you.\r\n     3. The next player will indicate that they will take your chunky and in turn will offer one for the next player.\r\n     4. The process will continue by playing it forward with hand-painted and collaged chunkies.\r\n     5. If your offer stays on the PIF for 7 days with no one claiming it, you will be required to offer a different card or cards. You are making a commitment to watch the thread and, if your chunky isn"t chosen by the seventh day after your post, to post another card ON OR BEFORE the seventh day. You must continue to post new chunky (at least one new card each 7 days, if not sooner) until one of your chunkies is finally claimed. Note: if you fail to do so within 7 days, your iTrader may be affected.\r\n     6. It is HIGHLY recommended that you subscribe to the group so you don"t miss out on great chunkies. \r\n     7. IMPORTANT: If you must offer a second chunky, do so in a NEW POST. \r\n  \r\n  Guidelines:\r\n  --- All chunkies must be mailed within two weeks of acceptance. If for some reason there is a delay, communication through pm is a must!\r\n  --- Itraders will be given between traders, please keep this in mind.\r\n  --- This is a international PIF, so be prepared to mail internationally.

Feel free to give details about the card you post, but responding to others should be via PM, visitor message, rep, etc. \r\n  --- You may not claim two cards in a row UNLESS three days have passed since you last played (either claimed a card or had one of your cards claimed).\r\n  \r\n  Card Details:\r\n  ---Any art medium is acceptable on a sturdy 4â€ x 4â€ base.

I have also installed Chrome and if I change the default browser to Edge or Chrome, the problem goes away.  Put it back to IE and the prompt reappears.  Very irritating!  I have spent a few days scouring the internet to find that issues in the past that caused a similar behaviour (i.e. installing them removing Chrome or Firefox) and the fixes mentioned (i.e. Registry hacks and imports/exports to the Registry, clearing caches and a Microsoft Fixit) do not solve the problem!  A fully-working Windows 8.1 machine did not have the problem - upgrade it to Windows 10 and the problem appears.\r\n \r\n I have reported it to Microsoft via the Windows Feedback (I am a member of the Technical Insider Programme) as I suspect it is a "feature" of Windows 10, but if anyone finds the fix and could post it here, I would be very grateful!  Many thanks.  						'),

I"ve checked all the Registry keys for the Classes and htm/html against what they were in Windows 8.1 and they are identical (I even imported the keys from W8.1 to a W10 VM just to be sure).  It"s not an Office issue either - hyperlinks in Word work fine.  So do Adobe Acrobat links in PDFs.  So IMHO the only things left that are likely to have been changed by the W10 upgrade are the DLLs and/or file rights and ownerships.  I must confess I am already a fan of W10 - to me, W10 is to W8 as W7 is to Vista!  The Start button is now good enough for me to use without the Classic Shell (http://www.classicshell.net/) install that I used with W8/8.1.  And the awful Metro screen has gone too :-)  I don"t know what others think, but I suspect the underlying architecture of W10 is much the same as W8.1, which is why I"ve never heard of any issues with driver or program compatibility.  Incidentally, just for others information, I too found that after upgrading, I could receive, but not send, emails from Outlook (even though the test send email in Accounts worked OK).  That problem was fixed by running "sfc /scannow" in a Command prompt running as Administrator - that was the only bug I have found.  						'),

Jaco will need a car (a good 4WD but it&#39;s well worth it). I haven&#39;t been to Ramelau but it&#39;s well off the main road and people normally go with a guide. For Atauro, the ferry or a hired boat is fine. Hiring a car in Dili is easy but they&#39;re not cheap. Roads and drivers are poor but there&#39;s not too much traffic and in August all the roads should be passable. Finding your way is the hardest part - no road signs and not a lot of English in the countryside, but the people will still try to help. Scooters would depend on how experienced you are. They might be fine in cities (although the traffic gets a bit dangerous in Dili) but to go anywhere else will involve a lot of dirt. '),

But, I am thinking of using public transport to get to some of the other places such as Baucau, Mundo Perido and Viqueque. I am happy to use mikrolets when I am in the towns. We have travelled through Cambodia and Laos using public transport and have stayed in some very basic places so that doesn&#39;t put me off, but I am concerned about the safety and the viability of travelling like this. Do you think it feasible? '),

Thanks in advance for your comments :)    Ken ', '    You can get buses to Baucau and Viqueque but I don&#39;t know any foreigners who have done it. There might be mikrolets in those towns, and probably car or motorcycle taxis, but not many. Cambodia and Laos are much more developed countries and are very used to tourists, whereas there are hardly any tourists in East Timor, so finding people to help you get where you want to go will be difficult unless you know the language (Tetun or Indonesian). If you arrive in town at a late hour (buses are not scheduled), finding accommodation will be very hard. It will be almost impossible to use local transport to see anything outside of the towns themselves (and there&#39;s not much in the towns). Mundo Perdido wouldn&#39;t have any transport at all. Safety might be an issue if there are no men with you (in general, East Timor is safe for men but women get severely harassed if alone).    As I said, I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s done this. It would be great to get a report on it but I&#39;d suggest only trying it if you&#39;re the hardest of adventurers. The east road is pretty easy to drive yourself, so you could certainly hire your own car. '),

Thanks in advance for your comments :)    Ken ', '    I wouldn&#39;t advice public transport from Dili to Bacau, because the scenery is so amazing, you&#39;ll miss it being stuck in the back of a public bus. I met some people that caught the bus and they saw nothing of the beautiful beaches, rice fields or mountains. There are lots of beaches worth stopping at fur a swim along the way.    I went by moped and left most of my stuff at a hotel in Dili and just took a daypack.    The roads are fine to get to Bacau on a moped or motorbike. And it&#39;s much cheaper than a car, about $30 dollars a day.    Tiger Fuel used to rent mopeds, but when we went there 3 weeks ago, they were all broken. You can hire bikes from Taltabi Motor Rental (tel: 7957364). It&#39;s difficult to find so here are the directions; when you cross the bridge in the direction of the airport, immediately take a sharp left (pretty much a u-turn) and you will find it. I&#39;m passing this information on because I spent my first 2 days in Dili running around in taxi after taxi trying to find bike hire, nobody knew anything about where we could hire a bike from.    It&#39;s great having a bike even when just staying in Dili, Areia Branca is beautiful to ride around and not having to catch taxi&#39;s everywhere gives you a lot of freedom. '),

Because I enjoy smaller towns, I would like to make Ollantaytambo my home base for about five days of exploring the Sacred Valley.  But I"m wondering if Urubamba is a better choice because it"s more central.  Any advice?', ''),
(91, 'http://www.travellerspoint.com/forum.cfm?thread=107947', 'Cusco, Peru', 'Yay - glad you have somewhere to stay   I truthfully didn"t spend much time in either Ollantaytambo or Urubamba, but in general I"ve just heard more about Ollantaytambo.  My guess is that either will be fine in terms of exploring the area.  I would just look to see if buses run regularly to each, but I would be quite surprised if they didn"t.  And I"m sure if you wanted to use any tour company for exploring, they"d be able to pick you up on the way.  When I hiked the Inca Trail, we made a stop in Ollantaytambo, so it may potentially be more touristy - if you"re looking to escape that, Urubamba may be a better bet.  But I"d continue asking around.  Also, since it sounds like you might be more into seeing the authentic side of things, you may want to check out some of the lesser hiked trails - I think there are some for Maras and Moray, Salkantay, and Rainbow Mountain.  Actually, the company that does the pisco class, -snip-, has some pretty good guides, if you want a guided tour.  Whatever you choose to do, the trip is going to be amazing!', ''),

It"s tricky to find out what fair prices are should be thout getting engaged with them about things you don"t really want to buy.  Take your time and inform yourself about prices.  Many people buy items labeled 100% alpaca that have no alpaca in them at all.  If you are going to make an expensive purchase, do it in a reputable store rather than from a small vendor.  Support the small vendors for inexpensive purchases.', ''),

One problem in Cusco - it really does get very cold there as soon as the sun starts to go down. Many of the buildings have very thick adobe walls which makes it really cold at night.  Before you book or check in, ask if they have a heater in the room.  Layers of heavy wool blankets are only good as long as you are in the bed!

In fact, I"d recommend it as a first or second day intro to the city.  Most people have trouble adjusting to the altitude the first few days so it is an easy way to get oriented and get a 2-hour introduction to the history, culture and archaeological sites.

Just take it easy for the first few days - eat light and avoid mountain trekking or other strenuous exercise.  Drink coca tea and muna tea as often as you can - just avoid coca tea in the evenings as it is a mild stimulant and may keep you awake.  Limit alcohol and stay hydrated. Get plenty of sleep.', ''),

Almost anywhere you go in Cusco and the Sacred Valley is going to entail climbing up hills - steep ones!  If you"re having trouble, find simple, slow activities without a lot of uphill walking (and no mountain trekking!) for the first days. I suggest a double-decker bus tour.
